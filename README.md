# Hackerrank_Basic_Practice

## Objective 
In this challenge, we review some basic concepts that will get you started with this series. You will need to use the same (or similar) syntax to read input and write output in challenges throughout HackerRank. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-hello-world/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task 
Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:

```pythoninsert``` i e: Insert integer  at position .
print: Print the list.
remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer .
append e: Insert integer  at the end of the list.
sort: Sort the list.
pop: Pop the last element from the list.
reverse: Reverse the list.

### Input Format

A single line of text denoting **_inputString_** (the variable whose contents must be printed).

### Output Format

Print **Hello, World.** on the first line, and the contents of **_inputString_** on the second line.

### Sample Input
```python
Welcome to 30 Days of Code!
```
### Sample Output
```python
Hello, World. 
Welcome to 30 Days of Code!
```

### Explanation

On the first line, we print the string literal **Hello, World.**. On the second line, we print the contents of the  variable **_inputString_** which, for this sample case, happens to be **Welcome to 30 Days of Code!**.

If you do not print the variable's contents to stdout, you will not pass the hidden test case.
